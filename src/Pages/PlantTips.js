      <h1>Corp Nutriention Management</h1>
      <p>
        Application of organic manure helps in maintaining the organic matter of
        the soil, which is very important for grape crop nutrition. Grape is
        also a heavy feeder and it should be supplied through proper fertiliser
        application at different stages of vegetative growth, fruiting and berry
        development stages. Most grape growers have started adopting drip
        irrigation and supplying the nutrients through the drip system.

            in controlling the nematodes. The soil should not be disturbed for
            at least 15 days. Thereafter normal manuring may be done.
            Application of neemcake 200 g/vine also helps in controlling
            nematodes.
